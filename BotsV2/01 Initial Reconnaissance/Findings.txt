Phase 1 – Internal Reconnaissance
Earliest Observed Activity

The first suspicious network activity was observed at:

2017-08-03 20:02:00 UTC

Host 10.0.1.1 initiated DCERPC communication with host 10.0.1.100 on TCP port 49155.

Port 49155 is an ephemeral RPC port typically negotiated after communication with the RPC Endpoint Mapper (Port 135).

IDS Detection

At:2017-08-03 20:02:17 UTC

Suricata generated the following alert:
ET SCAN Behavioral Unusual Port 135 traffic Potential Scan or Infection

This indicates abnormal RPC enumeration behavior consistent with lateral movement preparation.

Assessment

No external inbound traffic to 10.0.1.1 was observed prior to this activity.

The host was likely compromised before dataset capture.

Activity is consistent with internal reconnaissance and service enumeration.
