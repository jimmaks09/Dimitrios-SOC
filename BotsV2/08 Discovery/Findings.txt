Multiple host and network enumeration commands were executed on host MERCURY
under the Administrator account.

Observed commands:
- netstat -nao
- cmd.exe /c netstat -nao | findstr "LISTENING"
- whoami /user

The repeated execution of netstat suggests the attacker was identifying
listening services and active network connections, likely to determine
reachable C2 channels or lateral movement paths.
