Following the successful authentication using the service3 account on the mercury host, process execution activity consistent with remote command execution was observed.

At 2017-08-03 20:06:36 UTC, the following process was launched on mercury:

C:\Windows\System32\wsmprovhost.exe
with command line:

C:\Windows\system32\wsmprovhost.exe -Embedding

The wsmprovhost.exe process is the WinRM Provider Host, which is spawned when commands are executed remotely via:

WinRM
PowerShell Remoting
WMI

This strongly indicates that the attacker used the compromised credentials to obtain remote command execution on the mercury system.
Supporting Activity
Shortly after the wsmprovhost.exe execution, additional system commands were observed, including:

cmd.exe
netstat -nao
findstr "LISTENING"
WmiPrvSE.exe

These commands are commonly used by attackers for:
enumerating listening ports identifying running services
performing system discovery and confirm active remote interaction with the host.

Conclusion

Log evidence shows that after the brute force authentication and successful login, the attacker executed commands remotely on mercury using WinRM/WMI mechanisms.
This confirms that in Phase 4 the attacker achieved remote execution on the system and began post-compromise reconnaissance.
